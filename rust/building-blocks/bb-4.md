# PNA Rust &mdash; Building Blocks 4

Let's learn some building blocks!

Put your other projects and concerns aside. Take a breath and relax. Here
are some fun resources for you to explore.

Read all the readings and perform all the exercises. Also watch the video.

- **[Reading: Fearless Concurrency with Rust][f]**. This is a classic Rust blog
  post from [Aaron Turon][at] that clearly explains why concurrency is so easy
  in Rust. The title is also the origin of using the word "fearless" to describe
  various Rust properties.
  
- **[Reading: What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?][d]**.
  This is a 10 second read, but something to keep in mind. The two words are
  often used interchangably. We'll mostly use the word "concurrent" since it is
  more general than "parallel". Sometimes we'll use the word "parallel" to be
  more specific, sometimes because it sounds betterâ€¦

- **[Reading: Rust: A unique perspective][ru]**. An in-depth explanation of the
  dangers of mutable aliasing and how Rust solves the problem. This one
  is by [Matt Brubeck][mb], from the [Servo] team.

- **[Video: Rust Concurrency Explained][ex]**. A more in-depth talk by [Alex
  Crichton][ac]. Aaron and Alex wrote many of the concurrent data structures in
  the standard library. Alex has given versions of this talk for years, and it
  is a pretty great overview of what Rust can do.

- **[Reading: `std::sync`][ss]**. Once again, the standard library documentation
  provides good not only documentation about the library, but about the subject
  in general. It also of course provides an overview of the concurrent tools
  provided in the standard library.

- **[Exercise: Basic multithreading][bmt]**. This is a simple multithreading
  exercise from the [rustlings] project.

- **Exercise: Write a thread pool**. A [thread pool] runs functions (jobs) on a
  set of reusable threads, which can be more efficient than spawning a new
  thread for every job.

  Create a simple thread pool with the following type signature:

  ```rust
  impl ThreadPool {
    fn new(threads: u32) -> Result<Self>;

    fn spawn<F>(&self, job: F) where F: FnOnce() + Send + 'static;
  }
  ```

  The `new` function should immediately spawn `threads` number of threads, and
  then those threads will wait for jobs to be spawned. When a thread recieves a
  job, it runs it to completion, then waits for the next job.

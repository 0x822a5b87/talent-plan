# PNA Rust &mdash; Building Blocks 2

Let's learn some building blocks!

Put your other projects and concerns aside. Take a breath and relax. Here
are some fun resources for you to explore.

- **[Bitcask: A Log-Structured Hash Table for Fast Key/Value Data][bc]**.
  A simple but effective design for a key-value database. The one you
  are building will be inspired by it.

- **[Error Handling in Rust]**. Rust error handling is powerful, and many Rust
  programmers adore it once they have gotten the hang of it. But it is complex,
  and has a complex history of trial and error. This is a classic in-depth
  article on best-practices for error handling in Rust. It is from 2015, and
  there have been some minor changes to error handling since then, but there is
  a lot of wisdom in here. The author, [BurtSushi], has done much experimenting
  with Rust error handling, and is considered an authority on that and [other
  things].
